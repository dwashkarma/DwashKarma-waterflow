Day:Jan 24
First Half: Today I worked on express and nodeJs routes that we learnt yesterday. After that I worked and studied about the Array methods that Amar dai has gave  task to us. I studied well about the different array methods:
Array.length
Array.toString()
Array.push()
Array.pop()
Array.shift()
Array.unshift()
Array.slice(),splice(),toSpliced(),and soon.......

Second Hald: In the second Half there was the Node js ;backend session and in that session we learnt about the routing with the controllers which makes the folder structure more promising and well managed.We also learnt about the status 400,500 as well as the moongoose model overview. We installed moongoo DB in our laptop.
