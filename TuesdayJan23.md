First Half:
I was late today for the office because I went to the Pan office to collect the pan card. It took me 2 hours late to get in to the office...

In the first half I continued the task of Naasa Securities for the Search button that search the content and the step/answers part.
I completed the task within 1 hour and took a small break and continued with the node js.

Second Half:
In the second half there was a NodeJs session in which we learnt about the expressJS and routing method in backend usind express modules. I also got to know about the redirection from the express. Nishan dai gave us a task to make a simple routes using the express and Amar dai gave us task to make a simple project using array methods.
