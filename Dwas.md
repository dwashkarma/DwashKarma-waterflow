Hello I am Dwas


Date: 10/3

First Half : 
I entered at the office at 10 am and i greet my other friends who are also an Intern here.
We are assigned the Task of Figma Designing UI/UX for the first half so I was doing the task making the design of Capitalize fund in Figma.

Second Half :
In second half we interns study the project assigned and research on the basis of that so we can learn from that. So that I was researching on the Project: Naasa Securities and studying the tech stack needed for that which is NextJs. 
In Next Js I was learning the way for Routing and Other routing i.e: dynamic routing and parallel routing along with the loading UI.
