Today I studied Svelte.dev and created a SvelteKit which is a framework and learnt about the framework folder structure and life cycle method.
After that I continued the Nest Task in which I learnt about the constructor decorator and Api routes.
Along this I got to know the different event handlers in s.dev and binding method.
