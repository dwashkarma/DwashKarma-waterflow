Jan 25
First Half:
Today was a great day, I am pleased to have great friends,brothers and sisters in my office. I love the working environment of my office. On the first half I learnt more about the mongo DB and got the knowledge of backend part of the programming. I connected the backend part with the express routing with the mongoose and send the data to the database. My knowledge in backend has also grown well during this backend session.
Second Half:
In the second half of  the office time, I continued to work on the Naasa project and the task was adjusting the gap, alignments on the page of the Naasa website. I worked on that and after that there was a Backend session in which we got to learn more about the express Routing with the mongoose model/Schema maintaining the flow of data in the mongoDB. We connected the express server to the mongoCompass. After that we had a small program or meeting with the whole team where there was a discussion about the organization goal,working nature and the problems faced by the team.

As a whole, today was a great day....
