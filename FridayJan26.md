First Half:
In the first half, I worked on the Naasa Project in which I made the adjustment in Home page of Naasa Securities as well as pushing into the git that I have worked. I learnt about the git stash which temporarily stash the changes that I made on the working copy so that i can work on another task.
Second Half:
In the second half I work on the CRUD operation in Mongoose using express for the backend lesson. After that there was a backend session done by Arpan Dai where we learnt about the mongoose autheticating the user and crypting the password. Also we learnt about the JWT (json web Token) that provides the token.
